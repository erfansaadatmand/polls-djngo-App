## Django Project Overview

I completed the Django project tutorial provided by the official Django documentation [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/). Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with Django and familiarized myself with its fundamental concepts, including setting up a Django project, defining models, creating views and templates, handling forms, and deploying the application. By following the tutorial, I learned how to develop a web application using Django in a systematic and structured manner.
